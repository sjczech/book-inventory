# book-inventory

This web app functions as an inventory where users can keep track of books they own.  Each entry includes a unique ID, title, author, and genre. Users have the ability to view current entries, create new ones, edit existing entries, or delete unneeded ones.  

If you have Maven installed, you can clone the repository and open it your IDE. To run the application, <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code>.  Then point your browser to <code>http://localhost:8080/books</code>;
